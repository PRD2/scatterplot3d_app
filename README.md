# 3D Scatterplot Visualization App for Splunk

https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3138/

This visualization allows for you to view a scatterplot in three dimensions. Better yet, you can zoom, rotate, and orbit around the points, change aspect ratios, colors, sizes, opacity, labels and more !

Currently, this visualization supports 50,000 points and does not limit your categorical values. Download the app to see some examples.

This app was built with plotly.js, which combines WebGL and d3.js
